To run the semantic segmentation project, open the provided script in MATLAB and run it. The script will define the network, load the dataset, split it into training, validation, and testing sets, perform data augmentation, train the network, and evaluate its performance on the test set.

To run the image classification project, create a new script or modify the existing script to define a suitable network architecture for classification, and adjust training parameters as needed. Follow the same steps as in the segmentation project for dataset preparation, data augmentation, training, and evaluation.

Dependencies
MATLAB (R2019b or later)
Deep Learning Toolbox
Image Processing Toolbox (for data augmentation)
Computer Vision Toolbox (optional, for some visualization functions)

The classnet.mat is generated by classifciation.m for classifcation task.
The segmentnet.mat is generated by segmentation.m for segmentation task.
